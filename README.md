# Nelder-Mead-optimization-for-BTE-inversion
The single Si_cos_bkwrd_optim_NM.cpp file uses Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm to find phonon properties using temperature measurements of the transient thermal grating (TTG) experiment by solving the forward problem, the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
